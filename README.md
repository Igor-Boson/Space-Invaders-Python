# Space-Invaders-Python
Space Invaders remake in Python [UNFINISHED]

So far, I've implemented the following functionalities
1. Player movement
2. Shooting mechanic
3. Scoring
4. Enemy spawn and movement

It's still missing the core functionality of the player being able to "win the game" and the "game over" scenario.
All the functionalities listed still need to be polished, but their core functions are already implemented
